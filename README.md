# 🧼 CT Image Denoising Techniques – Implementation & Evaluation

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various denoising techniques for Computed Tomography (CT) images. Denoising plays a crucial role in enhancing medical image quality by reducing noise while preserving structural details essential for diagnosis.

## 🧪 Techniques Implemented

* Gaussian Filter
* Median Filter
* Bilateral Filter
* Non-Local Means
* Wavelet Denoising
* Deep Learning-based Denoising (optional or future scope)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
* Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Evaluation results are stored in the `results/` folder.

## 📷 Sample CT Images

Here are examples of raw and denoised CT images:

## 📥 Dataset

You can find the datasets used in this project at:

* [Kaggle: CT Medical Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ct-scan-images-for-covid)
* [TCIA Public Datasets](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
* Or any CT dataset you upload to the `data/` folder.

> Make sure to organize your datasets as described in the `README_data.txt` file inside the `data/` directory.

## 📈 Results & Analysis

Each method is evaluated quantitatively using PSNR, SSIM, and MSE, and qualitatively through visual comparison.

| Method           | PSNR ↑ | SSIM ↑ | MSE ↓ |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Gaussian Filter  | 28.9   | 0.75   | 145.3 |
| Median Filter    | 30.1   | 0.79   | 128.2 |
| Bilateral Filter | 31.2   | 0.82   | 114.5 |
| Non-Local Means  | 32.5   | 0.85   | 99.7  |

## 📌 Future Work

* Integration of deep learning-based denoising models (e.g., DnCNN, UNet)
* Real-time application on clinical scans
* Evaluation on multi-modal images (MRI, PET)
